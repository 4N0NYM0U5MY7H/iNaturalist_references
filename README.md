# iNaturalist References
Reference documentation for identifying observations on iNaturalist.

## About
This project contains the reference materials that I have used to provide identifications on iNaturalist.  The project began as a way for me to keep track of the references I have used, and has since grown into a project that I hope will help others.
> **Note**: Reference materials have been moved from this README and are now hosted on GitHub Pages.  The link below will take you to the appropriate page.
