# iNaturalist References
Reference documentation for identifying observations on iNaturalist.

## About
This project contains the reference materials that I have used to provide identifications on iNaturalist.  The project began as a way for me to keep track of the references I have used, and has since grown into a project that I hope will help others.

### Updates
This list is continuously updated. No removals are made; just additions. The list's structure and arrangement are subject to change over time. You can view these changes at: https://github.com/4n0nym0u5my7h/iNaturalist_references/commits/main.
> **Note**: Reference materials have been moved from this README and are now hosted on GitHub Pages.  The link below will take you to the appropriate page.

### Links
Links to publications' free, complete online versions will be given preference when accessible.
> **Note**: There will always be a DOI reference.  The links on this page that are related with the articles, however, could take you to an open access version of them rather than the originals, which might be hidden behind a paywall.
